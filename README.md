# Project

Welcome to the AI Gallery. This repo hosts multiple demos for AI use-cases across multiple industries. The purpose of this repository is to collect, share, and improve demos developped for AI products/solutions/services which have been proven impactful.

## ðŸš€ Adding your demo to the gallery

Currently, the onboarding process of new demos handles demos that are self hosted in your own project subscription. In other words, if your demo can be accessed via an URL, you can follow the steps below. If you need to host your demos in Azure, you may contact one of the contributor and we will help you onboard it.

This repository is fully config driven, making it easy to add your own demo in here.

To add your UI demo, the steps you need to take are:

1. Create your own branch: "your-name"/"your-demo"
2. Add a thumbnail of your UI (600 pixels x 400 pixels) to `gallery/app/static/assets/img/demo_thumbnails`
3. Add a screenshot of your UI (1600 pixels x 900 pixels) to `gallery/app/static/assets/img/demo_screenshots`
4. Add a new yaml file to `gallery/app/demo_configs`, following the yaml structure of the other demo configs as described below
5. Add the name of the `yml` file to the `gallery/app/demo_configs/.order` file in the position you'd like it to appear
6. Create a pull request from your branch to "develop" branch. Once accepted, you will be able to view your demo here: https://dstoolkit-gallery-dev.com/gallery.
7. If your demos is working correctly and all the information is correct, create a new pull request from "develop" to "main" to push the demo to the main page.
