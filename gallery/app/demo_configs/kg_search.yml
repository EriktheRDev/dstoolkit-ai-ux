description: In a domain specific search scenario, search terms may carry special meanings specific to a particular domain. Understanding the underlying meanings of those terms can help a search engine better interpret user intent to find more relevant results. This demo implements a domain-aware search solution that uses knowledge graph to expand the scope of search from the original query to semantically related queries with the goal of uncovering documents that are relevant to the search intent but may not contain the exact keywords as specified in the original query. 
feature_bullets:
  - Modularized code template to implement a domain-aware search solution with knowledge graph
  - An interactive frontend to compare the search results with and without knowledge graph
